        <p><b>
            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            As always, setting <b>m to 0</b> results in the zero_bounce_radiance rendering. This means only light rays that travel directly from the light source to the camera are accounted for, which results in only the light source being visible and all other surfaces being rendered as completely dark.
            Setting <b>m to 1</b> illuminates all faces based on rays that travel directly from the light source to the surface. For the walls and floor, this results in normal shading, except on the ceiling and underneath the balls which are completely dark as they don't receive any direct lighting. On the balls,
            the reflection regions are visible, as rays from the light may bounce off them and head to the camera. Refraction and reflected surfaces are not visible, however, as they require more than 1 bounce to reach the camera.
            When <b>m is set to 2</b>, the ceiling and previously shaded regions becomes vaguely illuminated. The reflective sphere represents a distorted view of the room with m=1: light from the camera travels to the sphere, where it is allowed one more bounce into the surrounding room. On the glass sphere,
            only some lighting is available, which only comes from pixels where the Shlick's approximation coin flip results in reflection.
            With <b>m=3</b>, complete refraction finally becomes available. Light rays travel from the surfaces, refract into the sphere, refract out of the sphere, and make contact with the outer surfaces. This results in a distorted view of the region behind the sphere. This also results in the bright spot below
            the glass sphere, as the refracted light from the light source can reflect back. On the reflective sphere, we see the distorted world from m=2, which means the glass sphere is still dark.
            With <b>m=4</b>, the glass sphere receives more noise, as it now displays the world and its surfaces with multiple bounces. Furthermore, a spot of glare appears on the right wall, most likely the light source, reflected off the mirror sphere and refracted through the glass one (4 bounces). The mirror
            sphere also updates to show the world with 3 ray bounces, which visibly appears more natural.
            The differences for <b>m=5</b> are much less substantial - some of the ambient lighting seems more complete, there's more glare from the glass sphere on the wall, the noise is more distributed across all kinds of surfaces. For the most part, however, there are no stand-out rays that terminate too soon.
            All of the most significant rays one would notice from the spheres are visible, rendering the scene a lot more realistic in appearance.
            Setting <b>m=100</b> actually does result in a couple noticeable effects - the shaded regions are slightly more lit, due to reflected light shining on them more, and the reflection of the light on the glass sphere is expanded in area. This is most likely due to the fact that more and more rays reflect
            off different surfaces back <i>towards</i> the light source, where they then bounce back onto the glass sphere. Since rays are more likely to reflect than refract in some areas, and reflection of direct light is more profound than refraction, more glare is produced.

        <p>Here we rendered CBdragon with mercury material instead of gold. Using the reference site provided on the
            spec and the fixed wavelengths for RBG leads us to an &eta; vector of {1.8795, 1.5472, 1.1353} and a &kappa; vector
            of {5.1076, 4.6437, 3.9980}. This refraction index corresponds to mercury at room temperature, which is
            liquid, so the render is not the most realistic, but the intended effect is clear. Visually speaking, the
            figure looks pretty similar to our render of a gold dragon with the same &alpha; value, even though the gold
            indices were quite different.
